ASP.NET (MVC) :-

-->In Asp.net Framework we have web.config file (configuration file) in which we can specify attibute as X-frame-options:Deny , SameOrigin ,etc .,  to Mitigate from clickjacking in web applications.

-->In Web.config file add this element .
(Path :-    C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG\web.config ) 
(Note: v2.0.50727 is framework version , you may have installed different version . Or open the project in visual studio and solution explorer ).



 <system.webServer>
    <httpProtocol>
      <customHeaders>
        <add name="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" />
      </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>
  </system.webServer>


--> Build your application and start IIS server and capture HTTP request in burpsuite, you can see X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN added in Response header.





ASP.NET CORE (MVC):-

--> In Asp.net Core we dont have web.config file . So, to mitigate clickjacking in web applications we have to add the X-Frame-Options header inside Configure() method in statup.cs file  which can be found in solution explorer.

--> Open statup.cs file and search for Configure() method.
Just add this code inside the method.

 app.Use(async (context, next) =>
            {
                context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Frame-Options", "SAMEORIGIN");
                await next();
            });
   
   
--> Rebuild your application and start IIS server and capture HTTP request in burpsuite, you can see X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN added in Response header.
